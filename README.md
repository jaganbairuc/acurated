# KM #
## A generic C++11 k-means clustering implementation ##

This is a k-means clustering algorithm written in C++, intended to be used as a header-only library. Requires C++11.

The algorithm is based on [Lloyds Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) and uses the [kmeans++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B) initialization method.

The library is located in the `include` directory and may be used under the terms of the MIT license (see LICENSE.md). The tests in the `src` directory are also licensed under the MIT license, except for lest.hpp, which has its own license (src/LICENSE_1_0.txt), the Boost Software License.

A basic benchmark can be found in the bench folder. An example of the current results on my x86_64 PC:

```
OpenCV: 1.51998ms
DKM: 0.044276ms
```

This is currently only running k-means on a small data set (150 samples), and currently only runs the test once, so do not interpret the results to mean that DKM is always faster than OpenCV. It however faster in this particular case.
